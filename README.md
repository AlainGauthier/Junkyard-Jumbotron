Junkyard Jumbotron
==================

The Junkyard Jumbotron lets you take a bunch of random displays and instantly stitch them together into a large, virtual display, simply by taking a photograph of them. It works with laptops, smartphones, tablets --- anything that runs a web browser. It also highlights a new way of connecting a large number of heterogenous devices to each other in the field, on an ad-hoc basis.

Here are instructions for installing the Junkyard Jumbotron.  Most of these
packages are available via apt-get on Linux, or in MacPorts of OS X (deployments
are intended to be on Ubuntu boxes, and currently most development happens on OS X).

To support the image processing you also need the 
[Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/).

You also need to compile the ARToolkit, which is included in the repo:
